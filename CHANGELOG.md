## 0.3.0.1
 - [#39](https://github.com/jhickner/smtp-mail/pull/39) @spencerjanssen
    - The `Bcc` field is stripped from the message before sending to the SMTP
      server. This is to prevent leaking the BCC contents to recipients.

## 0.3.0.0

- [#32](https://github.com/jhickner/smtp-mail/pull/32) @typetetris
    - add some functions to use SMTPS, which should be preferred to
      STARTTLS for mail submissions of endusers according to RFC 8314
    - add STARTTLS
    - add integration test using nixos tests

- [#30](https://github.com/jhickner/smtp-mail/pull/30) @typetetris
    - Replace `cryptohash` dependency with `cryptonite`.
      `cryptohash` is deprecated and `cryptonite` offers HMAC MD5
      directly.

## 0.2.0.0

- [#25](https://github.com/jhickner/smtp-mail/pull/25) @shulhi
    - References to the deprecated `Network` module were removed and replaced 
      with the new `connection` package. 
    - Duplicate functionality was deprecated.
- [#23](https://github.com/jhickner/smtp-mail/pull/23) @alexandersgreen
    - The `Cc` and `Bcc` fields will be sent to the SMTP server, and they'll 
      actually be sent now.
